Random features of Go;

1. To get the type of the variable just type "%T" in the print line, and at the end write the name of which you wanna get the type.
2. uint: Gives only postive whole numbers. (uint8, uint16......uint64)
3. int: Gives whole numbers can along with negative intgers. (int8, int16......int64)
4. To make your code clean you can use ":=" before assign the variable data type (It'll only work if you want to assign it as a variable)
5. To get user input use: fmt.Scan()
