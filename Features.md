Random features of Go;

1. To get the type of the variable just type "%T" in the print line, and at the end write the name of which you wanna get the type.
2. uint: Gives only postive whole numbers. (uint8, uint16......uint64)
3. int: Gives whole numbers can along with negative intgers. (int8, int16......int64)
4. To make your code clean you can use ":=" before assign the variable data type (It'll only work if you want to assign it as a variable)
5. To get user input use: fmt.Scan()
6. Range:
   i) iterates over elements for different data structures (so not only arrays and slices)
   ii) For arrays and slices, range provides the index and value for each element
  
8. strings.Fields();
   * splits the string with white space as seperator
   * Returns a slice with spilt elements
   

9. Blank Identifier("_");
* to ignore a variable ypu don't want to use.
* So with Go you need to make unused variable explicit.



10. Loops in GO;
* you only have one type of loop i.e for loop ( can be used for all diffrent cases)



11. If statements, if else statements, continue, break
12. Create diffrent function and can pass through
