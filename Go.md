To make a basic go program you need 2 files
1. Module path
 * Module path can correspond to a repository you plan to publish your module to
 * Command is *[ go mod init <module path> ]*
 * Only after creating this you can initiate your Go project.
2. The main Go file
 * It should start with: "package...."   
 * The program should include "func main" 
 * The "main" function is the entrypoint of a Go program 
3.
