To make a basic go program you need 2 files

1. Module path
 * Module path can correspond to a repository you plan to publish your module to
 * Command is * go mod init "module path" *
 * Only after creating this you can initiate your Go project.
   
2. The main Go file
 * It should start with: "package...."
 * Import packages (fmt,   
 * The program should include "func main" 
 * The "main" function is the entrypoint of a Go program
 * A program can only have 1 "main" function, because you can only have 1 entrypoint
   
3. To run the file
 * go run < file name> = compiles and runs the code.
